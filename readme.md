Took an existing code project that I originally built following a tutorial and challenged myself to edit code so that app 

1) game ends at best of 5
2) display a win or lose Game over message 
3) add a button to refresh page to play again

practiced creating a function with conditionals, inserting a function into existing switch statement, learned how to stop a function with conditional statement and return. created a function to reload page and then inserted it into html via a button. also used CSS to style new html div's and elements to match pre-existing code.
